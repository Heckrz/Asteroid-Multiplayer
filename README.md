# Asteroid-Multiplayer
We made an asteroid shooter that takes inspiration from the classic asteroid shooter arcade game

In the game the user is the space ship and can control it by using the controls:

UP : up arrow key

DOWN : down arrow key

LEFT : left arrow key

RIGHT : right arrow key

SHOOT : spacebar 

There is a highscore label along with the score and level labels. 
The highscore label shows the highest score of that session and the score label shows the current score.

We made the game using three programming languages, which are JavaScript, HTML and CSS

Responsibilities of the group members:

Omar : Server Side and Game programming

Jagmeet : Server Side and Game Programming

Sabah : Game Programming

Zainab : Game Programming

Jad : Game Programming, Game Designing and Recordings
